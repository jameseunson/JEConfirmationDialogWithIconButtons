Custom `confirmationDialog` that allows icons and labels in buttons. Ordinarily any image is stripped out of your button, when using the system `confirmationDialog`, however this distinctive look is possible using this small library.

- Looks identical to the system `confirmationDialog`.
- Allows `Label`, `Image` or any arbitrary view to be used as the `Button` label.


### Installation

JEConfirmationDialogWithIconButtons is available via the [Swift Package Manager](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift_packages/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app). Requires iOS 16.

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isSheetVisible = false
    var body: some View {
        Button("Show Sheet") {
            isSheetVisible = true
        }
    }
    .confirmationDialogWithIconButtons("Test Sheet", isPresented: $isSheetVisible, titleVisibility: .visible) {
        DialogIconButton {
            print("test")
        } label: {
            Label("Option 1", systemImage: "star")
        }

        DialogIconButton {
            print("test")
        } label: {
            Label("Option 2", systemImage: "square.and.arrow.up")
        }

        DialogIconButton(action: {
            print("test")
        }, label: {
            Label("Option 3", systemImage: "xmark.bin")
        },
        role: .destructive)

        DialogIconButton("Cancel", role: .cancel) {
            isTitleSheetVisible = false
        }
    }
}
```
